# Changes in this fork

The fork has been updated to the echart v.6.0.0.

1. New chart type - `heatmapGL` - was developed. \
   This chart was based on the scatterGL. And it has some limitation on styling in `itemStyle` (you can't use borders, or emphasis options).
   You can find example in <b>./test/hetamapGL-simple.html</b>

2. `ScatterGL`
   - items outside the grid boundary have been excluded from the rendering process.
   - <b>Only for series.large = false (default)</b>
     - The behavior for tooltip was fixed. Now it works with single item and with trigger = "axis".
     - The tooltip doesn't appear if the item is hidden by the visual map.
   - The warning - Canvas2D: Multiple readback operations using getImageData are faster with the willReadFrequently attribute set to true. See:sprite.js:132 - was fixed

3. `Fix for warning - 'Too many active WebGL contexts' has been added`. \
   Issue - [Too many active WebGL contexts warning](https://github.com/ecomfe/echarts-gl/issues/439) was added from [not merged PR](https://github.com/ecomfe/echarts-gl/pull/440)
